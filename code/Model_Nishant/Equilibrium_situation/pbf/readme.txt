Here we see how the various densities change for a fixed by p/f ratio but varying p and f. The calculations are done for 3 different ratios: 10^3, 10^4 and 10^5 which are stored in 3 folders.

We have 1 plot, f_variation.m where we plot the change in fractions as a funciton of p.
The other plots are the time evoultion of fractions for different p values. The p values used are from: 0.01 to 0.2 in steps of 0.01. (Please the name of the image)
