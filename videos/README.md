equilibrium2.mp4- it stores the video for an example of the state where all the fractions reach an equilibrium state.
[N=256x256, p=0.1, p/f=10^4]
periodic2.mp4-  it stores the video for an example of the state where all the fractions oscillate with time.
[[N=256x256, p=0.005, p/f=10^4]]


Dark green- trees

light green- empty sites

Dark yellow- fires

Just to mention, the fire is only at the ends of the propagating fires. This is not clearly visible in the compressed videos.


Clustering.avi- it shows the dynamics of cluster formation, merging of clusters and cluster burning as a function of time 
(for the case of zero burning time of clusters)
